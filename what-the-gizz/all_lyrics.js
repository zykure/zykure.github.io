            "Suspecting a trap, Sam Cherry suddenly turned, dashed through the line of Indians, regained the road, and ran for life, away from the Fort, followed by a number of yelling savages",
            "He was evidently doing well, when his horse stumbled and fell, breaking his neck, and pinning Sam's leg to the ground",
            "In an instant he was surrounded by the exultant Indians",
            "Raising himself slightly, Sam fired five shots at his enemies, then turning the muzzle against his own temple, he escaped the tortures of their vindictive rage by his last shot",
